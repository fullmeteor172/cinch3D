# Cinch3D: A Simple Orthographic Wireframe renderer

The goal of this project was to learn the workings of 3D renderers by implementing my own.
Cinch3D is an orthographic wireframe renderer that can parse and render Wavefront type .obj files.

This is a far-cry from the most efficient approach to making something like this, and it wasn't meant to be.

## Additional Information:
* Cinch3D can parse only trianglular faces.
* Camera controls are yet to be implemented.
* Draw functions make use of the olcPixelGameEngine.
